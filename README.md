ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anemomylos.

I'm the developer of EasyJoin and some other apps. I'm not sure why I'm editing this file, but now that I've started I can't leave it half done.

You can read about my apps at https://easyjoin.net and chat with me on <strike><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anemomylos">Reddit</a></strike> <a href="https://kbin.social/u/anemomylos">kbin.social</a>. 

I'm also on <a href="https://twitter.com/EasyJoin_dotnet">Twitter</a> but I don't hang out there often.

Ah yes, I'm also on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2827025/anemomylos">StackOverflow</a>, normally to find solutions to things I need. The few times I give answers is to questions that are ten years old, I ended up in those posts because I had the same problem to solve, which had not yet a solution or I had a better solution to propose.
