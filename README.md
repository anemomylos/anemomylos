ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anemomylos.

I'm the developer of Easyjoin and some other apps. I'm not sure why I'm editing this file, but now that I've started I can't leave it half done.

You can read about my apps at https://easyjoin.net and chat with me on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/anemomylos). 

I'm also on Twitter but I don't hang out there often (https://twitter.com/EasyJoin_dotnet).
